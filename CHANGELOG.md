## Supported Release 3.0.0 and 4.0.0
### Summary

This release adds new Puppet 4 features: data in modules, EPP templates, the $facts hash, and data types. This release is fully backwards compatible to existing Puppet 4 configurations and provides you with deprecation warnings for every argument that will not work as expected with the final 4.0.0 release. See the stdlib docs here for an in-depth discussion of this: https://github.com/puppetlabs/puppetlabs-stdlib#validate_legacy

If you want to learn more about the new features used or you wish to upgrade a module yourself, have a look at the NTP: A Puppet 4 language update blog post.

If you're still running Puppet 3, remain on the latest puppetlabs-apt 2.x release for now, and see the documentation to upgrade to Puppet 4.

#### Changes

Data in modules: Moves all distribution and OS-dependent defaults into YAML files in data/, alleviating the need for a params class. Note that while this feature is currently still classed as experimental, the final implementation will support the changes here.
EPP templating: Uses the Puppet language as a base for templates to create simpler and safer templates. No need for Ruby anymore!
The $facts hash: Makes facts visibly distinct from other variables for more readable and maintainable code. This helps eliminate confusion if you use a local variable whose name happens to match that of a common fact.
Data types for validation: Helps you find and replace deprecated code in existing validate functions with stricter, more readable data type notation. First upgrade to the 3.0.0 release of this module, and address all deprecation warnings before upgrading to the final 4.0.0 release. Please see the stdlib docs for an in-depth discussion of this process.

#### Bugfixes
- Fix apt::source epp template regression introduced in 3.0.0 for the architecture parameter

## Supported Release 2.4.0
### Summary
A release that includes only a couple of additional features, but includes several cleanups and bugfixes around existing issues.

#### Features
- Tests updated to check for idempotency.
- (MODULES-4224) Implementation of beaker-module_install_helper.
- Deprecation warnings are now handled by the deprecation function in stdlib.

#### Bugfixes
- Now http and https sources fixed for apt_key and can take a userinfo.
- GPG key update.
- Notify_update param now defaults to true to avoid validation errors.
- Implement retry on tests which pull key from a key server which sometimes times out (transient error).
- String comparison error now comphensated for in update.pp.
- (MODULES-4104) Removal of the port number from repository location in order to get the host name of the repository.
- Puppet lint warnings addressed.
- A few small readme issues addressed.

## Supported Release 2.3.0
### Summary
A release containing many bugfixes with additional features.

#### Features
- Apt_updates facts now use /usr/bin/apt-get.
- Addition of notify update to apt::source.
- Update to newest modulesync_configs.
- Installs software-properties-common for Xenial.
- Modulesync updates.
- Add ability to specify a hash of apt::conf defines.

#### Bugfixes
- A clean up of spec/defines/key_compat_specs, also now runs under STRICT_VARIABLES.
- Apt::setting expects priority to be an integer, set defaults accordingly.
- Fixed version check for Ubuntu on 16.04.
- Now uses hkps.pool.sks-keyservers.net instead of pgp.mit.edu.
- Updates and fixes to tests. General cleanup.
- Fixed regexp for $ensure params.
- Apt/params: Remove unused LSB facts.
- Replaced `-s` with `-f` in ppa rspec tests - After the repository is added, the "${::apt::sources_list_d}/${sources_list_d_filename}" file is created as an empty file. The unless condition of Exec["add-apt-repository-${name}"] calls test -s, which returns 1 if the file is empty. Because the file is empty, the unless condition is never true and the repository is added on every execution. This change replaces the -s test condition with -f, which is true if the file exists or false otherwise.
- Limit non-strict parsing to pre-3.5.0 only - Puppet 3.5.0 introduced strict variables and the module handles strict variables by using the defined() function. This does not work on prior versions of puppet so we now gate based on that version. Puppet 4 series has a new setting `strict` that may be set to enforce strict variables while `strict_variables` remains unset (see PUP-6358) which causes the conditional in manifests/params.pp to erroniously use non-strict 3.5-era parsing and fail. This new conditional corrects the cases such that strict variable behavior happens on versions 3.5.0 and later.

#### Backwards-incompatible changes

As this is a major rewrite of the module there are a great number of backwards incompatible changes. Please review this and the updated README carefully before upgrading.

##### `apt_key`
- `keyserver_options` parameter renamed to `options`

##### `apt::builddep`
- This define was removed. Functionality can be matched passing 'build-dep' to `install_options` in the package resource. [Example](examples/builddep.pp)

##### `apt::debian::testing`
- This class was removed. Manually add an `apt::source` instead. [Example](examples/debian_testing.pp)

##### `apt::debian::unstable`
- This class was removed. Manually add an `apt::source` instead. [Example](examples/debian_unstable.pp)

- This class was removed. See this [example](examples/release.pp) for how to achieve this functionality.

##### `apt::source`
- `include_src` - This parameter was removed. Use `include => { 'src' => <bool> }` instead. ***NOTE*** This now defaults to false.
- `include_deb` - This parameter was removed. Use `include => { 'deb' => <bool> }` instead.

#### Changes to default behavior
- By default purge unmanaged files in 'sources.list', 'sources.list.d', 'preferences', and 'preferences.d'.
